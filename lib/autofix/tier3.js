/**
 * ClawGuard - AutoFix Tier 3 (Flag-only)
 * by elizaldejorge
 *
 * For findings that we deliberately refuse to auto-fix, even with AI:
 *   - Dynamic code (eval, exec, child_process)  → may be intentional
 *   - Obfuscation (hex, base64 payloads, _0x…)  → possibly malware
 *   - Credential access (ssh, keychain, AWS)    → app-specific intent
 *
 * Correct response is flag + recommend quarantine, not patch.
